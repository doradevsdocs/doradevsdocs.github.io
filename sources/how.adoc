= [The Notes]How I got around this exercise

When I received this exercise, it didn't square as typical technical writing content for me but more like a web guide.

Here's how I went about this task:

. Performed some research. Selected a key topics to include in my guide for redacting. 
Following your instructions, I worked from the premise that accuracy wasn't relevant for the purposes of this exercise.

Besides my personal experience, I used the following sources as a basis for my content:

* https://www.deco.proteste.pt/auto/automoveis/simule-e-poupe/financiamento-automovel/resultados?list
* https://creditorapido.pt/carros-usados-credito/
* https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0056-financing-or-leasing-car#Before

* https://www.wikihow.com/Buy-a-Car
* https://www.deco.proteste.pt/auto/automoveis/simule-e-poupe/financiamento-automovel/faq/howtochoose

. I wrote a draft. Drew the topics "Do you need a car" and "Where to find it" more from experience and wrote the other topics taking the main points from the 
cited sources.
+
NOTE: About the Pros and Cons section in the guide. I opted specifically not to break each point into a separate bullet item but to 
 have pragraphs comparing both options as in a conversation with a friend, where we go back and forth considering both sides to a matter.
For example: "With an old car you don't know if it was in a serious accident, but you also you can always get a unit out of the factory 
that's defective. But chances are lower and you'll have warranty."

. Decided on a presentation/distribution method.

==[The Notes] About the presentation/distribution

* *Formats* - I used pandoc(.org) to convert a docx into a asciidoctor file to do the bulk of the work(syntax) for me and post processed it.

* *Presentation* - I used a infographic template from https://www.canva.com/ to create a mockup of a web leaflet. I exported this project in png and collated all the images in one file using Paint.net.

* *Distribution* - I created a github repo and uploaded the HTML output.This output was built with the asciidoctor's static site generator from the asciidoctor sources.


 I also created a markdown version which is contained in the repo's Readme file.



As a note, here's a pic of the original canva template I selected:

Here's a pic of the edited template ready to export:

NOTE: I wanted to provide a more dynamic/complex presentation of the content (answer to exercise) but I had several constraints (mainly time).
Ask me about this later if you find it relevant, cheers.
